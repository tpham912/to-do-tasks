**1. HTML (Structure)**
Elements and Tags: Understand the basic HTML structure, including tags like <div>, <ul>, <li>, <input>, <button>, etc.
Forms and Inputs: Learn how to use forms, input fields, and buttons, as these will be essential for adding new tasks.
Document Object Model (DOM): Familiarize yourself with how HTML elements are structured in the DOM and how they can be accessed and manipulated using JavaScript.

**2. CSS (Styling)**
Selectors: Understand how to select HTML elements to style them, including class selectors, ID selectors, and element selectors.
Box Model: Review the box model (margin, padding, border, content) to properly space and align your elements.
Flexbox/Grid: Learn how to use Flexbox or CSS Grid to layout your to-do list items responsively.
Basic Styling: Practice styling buttons, inputs, and lists to make your to-do list visually appealing.

**3. JavaScript (Interactivity)**
Variables and Data Types: Understand how to store and manage the data for your to-do list (e.g., an array of tasks).
Functions: Learn how to write functions to add, delete, and toggle tasks (completed or not).
Event Listeners: Understand how to add event listeners to buttons and inputs to handle user actions like adding a new task or marking a task as complete.
DOM Manipulation: Learn how to manipulate the DOM to dynamically add, remove, or update elements on the page.
Loops and Conditionals: Review loops (like for and forEach) and conditionals (if statements) to iterate over tasks and conditionally render different states.

4. Additional Concepts
Local Storage (Optional): Learn about localStorage in JavaScript if you want to save the to-do list items even after the page is refreshed.
Basic Debugging: Practice using browser developer tools to debug your code and fix any issues that arise.

**5. Project Structure**
Organizing Code: Consider how you'll organize your HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files. Start with a simple structure and evolve it as needed.
Reviewing these concepts will prepare you to build a basic but functional to-do list project. Once you're comfortable with them, you can start coding your project step by step.
